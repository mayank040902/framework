/**
 * Performance regression tests.
 *
 * These deliberately avoid absolute throughput assertions. Machine speed
 * varies too much for a fixed ops/sec threshold to be meaningful, and a flaky
 * performance gate gets deleted, which is worse than having none.
 *
 * What they do assert is *shape*: that cost scales with the size of the plain
 * data actually logged, and not with the size of an object graph merely
 * referenced by a binding. The historical failure mode is a
 * `logger.child({ req: incomingMessage })` that recursively walked
 * socket -> connection -> parser -> ..., which cost ~26.8us/call against
 * ~1.6us/call for the non-walking implementation. A ratio test catches a
 * return to that behaviour even on a faster or slower machine, because both
 * sides of the ratio are measured on the same run.
