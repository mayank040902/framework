# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-30

### Added

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting the pino pipeline, why the redaction walker
  runs before serializers, and the plain-vs-runtime object boundary.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering security disclosure, the checks a change must
  pass, and the behaviors that look like bugs but are deliberate.
- Security suite (`test:security`, 72 tests) covering redaction by key
  position, casing, `toJSON` routes, errors, child bindings, hostile payloads,
  circular references, mutation, and the eight security invariants.
- Performance suite (`test:perf`) asserting cost *shape* rather than absolute
  throughput, including a deterministic identity guard against object-graph
  traversal.
- Serializer, Fastify integration, and public API suites (`test:serializers`,
  `test:integration`, `test:api`).
- `tsconfig.test.json` so `npm run typecheck` covers the test suite, which was
  previously unchecked.
- `createLogger` accepts a `destination` option.

### Changed

- Published as `@oneunit/logger` (see Naming below). Workspace references in
  `packages/server` (dependency, optional peer dependency, and the dynamic
  import in its logger plugin), `examples/combined`, and `docs/` were updated
  to match.

### Security

- **Query strings are now stripped from URLs logged directly by application
  code.** The stripping previously applied only to `req.url`, via the request
  serializer, so `logger.info({ url: request.url })` — a very common shape —
  logged the query string in plaintext and the documented "query strings are
  stripped by default" guarantee silently did not hold. `url`, `originalUrl`,
  `requestUrl`, `href`, `referer`, and `referrer` are now stripped at any
  depth, inside arrays, and in child bindings. A field that merely contains a
  `?` but is not URL-bearing is left alone.
- Redaction now masks sensitive keys at any nesting depth, in arrays, in mixed
  object/array structures, and regardless of key casing. It previously relied on
  a shallow `*.password`-style path list that did not cover deep payloads.
- Redaction is applied in **every** mode, not only `production`, so a secret
  cannot reach a log sink from a local development or test run.
- Query strings are stripped from logged URLs by default across all three
  entry points (`createLogger`, `createSerializers`, `createHttpLogger`). The
  raw `queryString` field is omitted too, since stripping only the URL left the
  same secrets in the emitted line.
- Child logger bindings are redacted before pino pre-serializes them. Bindings
  bypass `formatters.log` and the `redact` stringifiers entirely, so
  `logger.child({ apiKey })` previously wrote the secret in plaintext.
- Added `privateKey` / `private_key` and `proxy-authorization` to the
  sensitive-key policy.
- Serialized request/response headers are covered by pino's native `redact`
  paths, closing the gap for fields that only exist after serialization.
- Hostile payloads (throwing getters, `Proxy` traps, 20k-deep nesting,
  self-returning `toJSON`) no longer abort a log call.
- Logging never mutates caller-owned objects.

### Fixed

- **`@bootstrap-framework/server` silently lost package logging.** Its logger
  plugin imported `@bootstrap-framework/logger`, which no longer exists after
  the rename, and the surrounding `try`/`catch` swallowed the resolution error
  and fell back to a bare Fastify logger. Consumers installing the renamed
  package got no package serializers, redaction, or level formatting, with only
  a warning to show for it. The dependency, optional peer dependency, and
  dynamic import are updated, and the workspace lockfile regenerated.
- **Errors kept their diagnostic value.** Redacting an `Error` that carried a
  sensitive property flattened it into a plain object of own-enumerable keys.
  `message` is non-enumerable and V8 implements `stack` as an accessor, so both
  were dropped, and pino's error serializer no longer recognized the value as an
  `Error` — every such log line lost its message and stack trace. Copies now
  preserve the prototype and non-enumerable properties, and accessors are
  materialized once into data properties.
- `createLogger` accepts a `destination` option. pino only accepts a
  destination as a positional argument, so a destination passed inside the pino
  options object was silently ignored and output went to stdout.
- The request serializer falls back to a string `request.url` when the standard
  serializer resolves no URL, instead of dropping the field. Still fails closed:
  a framework `url` object is never emitted verbatim.
- `createHttpLogger` no longer runs `defineConfig` unconditionally and discards
  the result when a logger instance is supplied.
- The `pretty` transport target no longer silently drops its `destination`.

### Performance

- Bound runtime objects (requests, sockets, model instances) are passed through
  by reference instead of being deep-walked. Measured `redactBindings` cost on a
  100-deep class instance is flat against a small one (0.72 vs 0.69 us/call);
  a traversal regressed this path to ~26.8 us/call.

### Documentation

- Documented that class/model instances bound as values are **not** recursively
  redacted. This is a deliberate trade to avoid per-call graph traversal, and it
  is asserted in the test suite so a future change has to revisit it.
- Fastify integration must use `loggerInstance`; passing the logger as
  `logger` makes Fastify build its own logger and bypasses this package.

## Naming

This package is published as **`@oneunit/logger`**. An earlier draft referred to
it as `@bootstrap-framework/logger`; that name was never published to the npm
registry, so there is no earlier release to upgrade from and no deprecation
path. If you installed a git or file reference to that name, switch to
`@oneunit/logger`.

Scope-wide, the underlying repository moved from `mayank040902/framework` to
`mayank040902/oneunit`; GitHub redirects the old URL.
