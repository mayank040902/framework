 * QueueEvents that can be closed after a failed startup.

 * BullMQ's own `close()` awaits `this.client` before disconnecting, and that
 * getter resolves to the connection's `initializing` promise. When the
 * connection never became ready that promise has already rejected with
 * "Connection is closed.", so `close()` throws before it reaches
 * `connection.close()` and the duplicated ioredis client is left running its
 * reconnect loop. Nothing else in the process can stop it, because the caller
 * has no reference to the duplicate, so the process never exits.
 *
 * `Queue` does not have this problem: `RedisConnection.close()` handles
 * `status === "initializing"` itself.
 *
 * Disconnecting the duplicate first is safe in both directions. When the
 * connection is healthy, `disconnect()` ends it and the subsequent
 * `connection.close()` sees a client already at `end` and skips its own quit.

/**
 * True for the "this connection is already gone" family of errors.
 *
 * `ConnectionClosedError` is checked first and structurally, because BullMQ
 * introduced it for exactly this reason — its own comment on the class says it
 * exists so `isNotConnectionError` can "do a structural `instanceof` check
 * rather than fragile message-substring matching". Matching the message cannot
 * work here: only some of BullMQ's construction sites pass ioredis's
 * `CONNECTION_CLOSED_ERROR_MSG`, and the others pass their own wording or no
 * message at all, in which case the class default (`"Connection is closed"`,
 * with no trailing period) applies. An exact string comparison therefore
 * rethrows precisely the failures this function exists to absorb, and the
 * caller gets an exception from teardown instead of a clean close.
 *
 * The string clauses stay as a fallback: they still cover a `bullmq` error that
 * predates the class, and an error forwarded from another adapter. `instanceof`
 * is identity-based, so a consumer with two copies of `bullmq` in one tree
 * would miss the class check — the fallbacks catch the ioredis wording, and
 * missing them is the safe direction to fail.
