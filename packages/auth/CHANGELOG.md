All notable changes to this package are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.1

Security fixes and session revocation. One breaking change: tokens are no longer
read from the query string unless you opt in.

### Security

- **Password hashing parameters taken from a stored hash are now bounded.** The
  `N`, `r`, `p`, and `keyLength` fields are parsed out of the stored hash string,
  so they are attacker-influenced wherever an attacker can write a user row.
  Node's own `maxmem` guard only covers the `128 * N * r` memory block, which
  left the other two unbounded: a single stored hash of
  `scrypt$16384$8$1$1073741824$...` cost **25.3 seconds of CPU** on a default
  configuration, repeatable on every login attempt, for one string of attacker
  input. All four parameters are now range-checked before scrypt runs, on both
  the hashing and the verifying path, and an out-of-range hash is reported as
  malformed instead of computed. `N` must additionally be a power of two and
  `N * r` must fit in 24MB of working memory, so a parameter set the platform
  would reject is refused up front rather than throwing from inside OpenSSL.
  A floor is enforced too: a stored hash asking for trivial work (`N=2, r=1`)
  verifies instantly and is a brute-force shortcut, so it is rejected.
- **Apple `id_token` signatures are now verified.** The claims in an Apple
  `id_token` are now checked against Apple's published JWKS before anything is
  read out of them. Previously the payload was decoded and trusted, so
  `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` were only as trustworthy as the token's own contents:
  anyone able to influence the token response could choose the subject, the
  audience, and the expiry. Verification pins `RS256` and requires a `kid`, so
  `alg: "none"` and JWT algorithm-confusion are refused. Keys are cached for an
  hour and an unknown `kid` triggers one refetch, so a routine Apple key
  rotation is invisible to callers. `exp` is now required rather than checked
  when present, since a token with no usable `exp` was previously treated as
  never expiring.
- **Refresh tokens without a `jti` are refused.** `refresh()` only consulted the
  refresh store when the token carried a `jti`, so a token without one skipped
  the store entirely and could never be revoked — it stayed valid until it
  expired and survived logout. `encodeRefreshToken` is a public export, so this
  was reachable by anyone holding the secret. A missing `jti` is now an
  `UnauthorizedError`. Refresh tokens minted by `login()` always have one, so
  this only affects tokens you built yourself.
- **Tokens are no longer read from the query string by default.**
  `extractToken()` fell through to `?access_token=` or `?token=` on every
  request, putting the token in access logs, proxy logs, browser history, and
  the `Referer` header sent to third parties. Pass `{ query: true }` to restore
  it, for flows that genuinely cannot set a header (EventSource, file
  download). Header and cookie extraction are unchanged and remain the default.

### Added

- **Session revocation.** Configure a `sessionStore` and tokens carry an `sv`
  claim, so a session can be invalidated before its token expires:

  ```js
  const auth = createAuth({
    secret,
    sessionStore: {
      getVersion: (userId) => db.getVersion(userId) ?? 0,
      bumpVersion: (userId) => db.incrementVersion(userId),
      revokeSession: (jti) => db.deleteSession(jti),
    },
  });

  await auth.revokeAllSessions(userId); // every device
  await auth.revokeSession(jti);        // one session
  ```

  `refresh()` is covered as well as `verify()`, so a revoked session cannot mint
  a fresh access token. This is opt-in and costs one store read per
  verification; without a `sessionStore`, `revokeAllSessions()` returns `false`
  rather than silently appearing to succeed. Numeric and string user ids
  resolve to the same version.

### Changed

- `verifyIdTokenSignature`, `jwksUrl`, `jwks`, and `jwksCacheTtlMs` are
  available on the Apple provider for key-cache control. Signature verification
  is on by default; `verifyIdTokenSignature: false` exists for test harnesses
  and should not be used in production.
- `hashPassword` now throws `ValidationError` for out-of-range parameters
  instead of letting the error escape from OpenSSL.
- Tests run entirely offline: the Apple suite signs real tokens with a generated
  RSA key pair rather than reaching Apple's JWKS endpoint.

## 2.0.0

Security hardening. Every breaking change below is a case where the previous
behavior was exploitable or silently incorrect. Upgrade notes follow the
release.

### Security

- **Identity and permission claims can no longer be overridden.** Extractors and
  `additionalClaims` are applied after the derived claims, so a name collision
  silently replaced them: `login(user, { additionalClaims: { sub: "admin" } })`
  minted a token claiming `sub: admin` for user 42, and an extractor named `sub`
  rewrote the subject outright. `sub`, `userId`, `roles`, `permissions`, `typ`,
  `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, and `jti` are now reserved —
  `registerExtractor()` throws on a reserved name, reserved keys returned in an
  extractor's object are dropped, and `login()` rejects an `additionalClaims`
  entry naming one. Non-reserved names such as `name`, `email`, `tier`, or
  `tenantId` are unaffected.
- **Apple `id_token` claims are validated.** Apple is the only built-in provider
  whose profile comes from a token in the code-exchange response rather than a
  server-side userinfo call, so its `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` were read with no
  validation at all — a token with a wrong issuer, a wrong audience, or an
  expired `exp` was accepted. They are now checked against the configured
  `clientId` and the current time, and a mismatch throws `ProviderError`. The
  RS256 signature is still not verified; see `ARCHITECTURE.md` for why that is
  not reachable through `loginWithOAuth()`, and what to do if you forward an
  `id_token` from elsewhere.
- **Refresh tokens are no longer accepted as access tokens.** `verify()` and
  `verifyRequest()` reject a token whose `typ` is `refresh`. Access and refresh
  tokens share a signing key by default, so a 7-day refresh token previously
  authenticated as a bearer credential on every protected route.
- **`register()` ignores caller-supplied roles.** A `roles` field in the input
  argument is discarded. A public sign-up form posts directly into that
  argument, so the field let any caller mint themselves a privileged role.
- **Access token permissions come from RBAC roles only.** A `permissions` array
  on the user record is no longer copied into the token, where it would have
  been indistinguishable from a role-derived grant.
- **`logout()` no longer reports success when nothing was revoked.** If the
  configured `refreshStore` implements neither `consume` nor `revoke`,
  `revoke()`, `logout()`, and `refresh()` throw `ConfigurationError` instead of
  returning a `true` that invalidated nothing. A store implementing only
  `consume()` can both rotate and log out, since the two are interchangeable for
  removing a specific id.
- **Refresh rotation is atomic.** `refresh()` uses the new `RefreshStore.consume()`
  when present, so one token can no longer be redeemed twice by concurrent
  requests. Stores without `consume` fall back to `get()` + `revoke()` and now
  require `revoke()`.
- **The Koa adapter no longer masks downstream errors.** `next()` moved outside
  the `try` block, so a handler error propagates to Koa's error handling instead
  of being rewritten as a `401 AUTH_ERROR` response.

### Fixed

- Token extraction reads `Authorization` and `Cookie` from a WHATWG `Headers`
  object, whose `forEach` passes `(value, key)`. Both arguments were previously
  inverted, so such requests produced no headers and always returned 401.
  uWebSockets.js `(key, value)` handling is unchanged.
- `fastifyAdapter` honors `optional` configured on the plugin, not only when
  passed per route.
- `revoke()` pins `algorithm` and `clockTolerance` to the configured values
  instead of defaulting to HS256 with no leeway, and rejects non-refresh tokens.
- `refresh()` now honors `clockTolerance`.
- Registering an aliased OAuth provider no longer overwrites the canonical
  provider entry.
- `matchPermission` supports `**` as a multi-segment wildcard, so `posts.**`
  matches `posts.a.b`. `*` still stays within a single segment.
- An unparsable `expiresIn` (`"1y"`, `"2 hours"`) throws `ValidationError`
  instead of silently defaulting to 24 hours in one place and failing in
  another, which let a token's real expiry diverge from a locally computed one.
- **OAuth login now fails closed when the profile carries no subject id.**
  Previously the fallback user id was `` `${provider}:${profile.id}` ``, so a
  provider response missing the id produced the subject `"google:undefined"` and
  every social user collapsed onto one identity. `loginWithOAuth()` now throws
  `ProviderError`. Map a stable id in the provider's `profileMap`.
- `loginWithOAuth()` accepts a bare query string (`"code=abc&state=xyz"`). The
  `URL` constructor parsed it as a path with no query, so the code silently came
  back empty and the call failed with "missing authorization code". Full URLs,
  paths with a query, and a leading `?` continue to work.
- `package.json` and `.npmignore` end with a trailing newline.

### Added

- `pkceVerifier()` and `pkceChallenge()` are now exported from the package entry
  point. Public clients implementing PKCE by hand had no supported way to
  generate a verifier or compute the S256 challenge, even though
  `OAuthAuthorizeOptions.codeVerifier` and `authorize()`'s returned
  `codeVerifier` are public API.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — module layout, token lifecycle, refresh-store contract,
  trust boundaries, and the security invariants the test suite enforces.
- `RefreshStore.consume(id)` — optional atomic read-and-delete. Preferred over
  `get()` + `revoke()`.
- `AuthOptions.trustUserPermissions` — opt back in to copying a user record's
  `permissions` into the access token. Defaults to `false`.
- `JwtVerifyOptions.acceptTokenType` — accept a `refresh` token in `verify()`.
  Defaults to rejecting it.
- `isValidExpiresIn()` — exported TTL validator.
- `test/security.test.ts` — regression tests for each fix above, plus
  `alg: none`, cross-secret, cross-algorithm, concurrent-rotation, hostile
  scrypt parameters, OAuth identity-collapse, callback parameter shapes,
  RBAC cycle/deep-chain/wildcard-boundary, and PKCE RFC 7636 cases.
- GitHub Actions workflow running typecheck, tests, build, `pack:check`, and
  `pnpm audit` on Node 20/22/24, then installing the packed tarball into a clean
  project to verify the public API and the shipped examples.
- `npm run example`, `example:standalone`, and `example:oauth` scripts.

### Changed

- **Shipped examples import `@oneunit/auth` instead of `../src/index.js`.**
  `src/` is not published, so every example previously failed with
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for anyone who installed from npm. A `paths` mapping in
  `tsconfig.json` keeps in-repo typechecking pointed at source, and Node's
  package self-reference resolves the built `dist/` at runtime.
- **Removed the `express`, `fastify`, and `koa` peer dependencies.** The adapters
  never import any of them — they duck-type the request and response objects —
  so the peers misrepresented the contract. The package now has one runtime
  dependency, `jsonwebtoken`.
- Replaced the `bootstrap-framework` npm keyword with `oneunit`.
- Deleted `.npmignore`. The `files` array in `package.json` is authoritative and
  two competing lists would drift.

### Migration

**If you call `auth.register(input)` and relied on `input.roles`:**

```diff
- await auth.register({ email, password, roles: ["member"] });
+ await auth.register({ email, password }, { roles: ["member"] });
```

**If you store permissions on the user record and expect them in the token:**

```diff
- const auth = createAuth({ secret });
+ const auth = createAuth({ secret, trustUserPermissions: true });
```

Prefer granting those permissions through an RBAC role instead.

**If you use a custom `refreshStore`:**

Implement `revoke()` at minimum. Implement `consume()` as a single atomic
operation (`GETDEL`, `DELETE ... RETURNING`, `findOneAndDelete`) so concurrent
refreshes cannot both succeed.

```ts
const refreshStore = {
  async save(record) { /* ... */ },
  async get(id) { /* ... */ },
  async consume(id) { /* atomic read + delete */ },
  async revoke(id) { /* ... */ },
};
```

**If you have `@oneunit/auth` in `peerDependencies` or `optionalDependencies`:**

Remove it. The adapters never import a web framework, so there is nothing to
satisfy. Keeping it forces an unnecessary install.

**If you vendor or fork the examples:**

They now import from `@oneunit/auth` rather than `../src/index.js`, because
`src/` is not published. Copy them into your own project and the import already
resolves.

**If you call `auth.verify()` on a refresh token:**

Use `auth.refresh()` instead. Pass `{ acceptTokenType: "refresh" }` only if you
genuinely need the raw claims.

**If your login route passes a request body into `auth.login()`:**

`login()` is a low-level primitive and never validated roles. Resolve the user
through a store first. See `examples/express.ts` for the correct shape.
